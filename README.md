# GameCo Analysis Project
We take the role of a market analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, we are tasked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCoâ€™s new games might fare in the market.

## Context and Key Questions
To shape their understanding of the video games market, GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights we can pull from the data, but are specifically interested in answering the following questions:

* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
